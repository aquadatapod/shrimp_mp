# Meta-Data for Microplastic Accumulation in Global Shrimp Communities

This repository contains the data and analysis related to a study investigating microplastic accumulation in shrimp communities across various global locations. The aim of this project is to understand the prevalence, characteristics, and potential drivers of microplastic ingestion in shrimp, utilizing quantile regression for detailed analysis and modeling.

## Data Files

The primary datasets used in this study are:

* **`shrimp_mp.xlsx`**: This file contains the core data for the quantile regression analysis and modeling. It includes information on microplastic accumulation in shrimp, alongside  relevant geographical and shrimp morphometric parameters.
* **`mp_characteristics.xlsx`**: This file provides detailed information on the characteristics of the microplastics found, such as size, shape, color, and polymer type. This data can be referenced for further insights into the plastic debris ingested by shrimp.
