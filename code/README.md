# Modeling Microplastic Accumulation and Morphometric Characteristics in Shrimp Communities

---

This repository contains the R code used for modeling microplastic accumulation in shrimp communities and analyzing their morphometric characteristics, specifically weight and length.

## Project Overview

In this project, we employ a data-driven approach to compare and analyze various models to determine the best fit for understanding microplastic accumulation and its relationship with shrimp morphometry. The aim is to identify the most suitable model for the present study, providing robust insights into this critical environmental issue.

## Associated Publication

The code within this repository is a component of a manuscript that has been submitted to **Nature Food Journal**. We anticipate that the publication of this work will contribute significantly to the understanding of microplastic dynamics in marine ecosystems.
